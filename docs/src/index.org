#+title: RestClient

Interacting with a RESTful API is fairly simple, but there's often a fair bit of
boilerplate involved in making well-formed requests, handling serialisation and
deserialisation, request limiting, and result pagination.

=RestClient= aims to take care of as much of this boilerplate as possible.
See the tutorial for a sense of what this looks like in practice.
